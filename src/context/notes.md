create fake DB using a JSON file -see brads MERN ecom for example
Context to manage the state of the app

this video may be short and helpfull reminder https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ_l-1zpVBo
Put into context State needs to be accessable to entier app
sorting into 2 files the context and the reducers
Inside Context.js is Cart.Provider it will wrap the entire app

have the context and reducers set up now at 25:58 into this video - need to use the data from CEUdata.js to populate a page. Start with weh WebinarClasses page which is useing the SingleClass.js component

Also there are a ton of errors in the console - may go away as I use the actual data

in Brads course from 2020 he used s 3 file methond with types file to organize this
Note that in Brads example he wrappped the App in App.js, not index.js
Not sure which is best practice
