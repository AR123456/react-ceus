Context to manage the state of the app

this video may be short and helpfull reminder https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ_l-1zpVBo
Put into context State needs to be accessable to entier app
sorting into 2 files the context and the reducers
Inside Context.js is Cart.Provider it will wrap the entire app

in Context map the data - breaking here right now. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HptuMAUaNGk

in Brads course from 2020 he used s 3 file methond with types file to organize this
Note that in Brads example he wrappped the App in App.js, not index.js
Not sure which is best practice
